# linktree-clone
An overengineered and unscalable static site made with **vite** **reactjs** and **tailwind** 

just a hobbyist site i made since I'm narcissistic enough to share most of my terminally online persona to the world, but too broke to pay for a customizable linktree subscription 

# to run the project

> git clone https://github.com/potatomat0/linktree-clone
> cd linktree-clone
> npm i 
> npm run dev
